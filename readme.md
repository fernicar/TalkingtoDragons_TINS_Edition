# üê≤ Dragon Diffusion - Talking to Dragons üê≤

**Professional Prompt Enhancement Suite**

Welcome, digital alchemists and prompt enchanters! Ever felt like your image generation prompts were more like whimpers than roars? Fear not! **Dragon Diffusion - Talking to Dragons** is here to transform your measly prompt scraps into magnificent, fire-breathing descriptions that'll make even the most stubborn AI dragons sit up and pay attention! ‚ú®

This mystical application harnesses the power of local Ollama models to take your basic prompts and enhance them into rich, detailed masterpieces worthy of the finest image generation spells. Say goodbye to bland "cat on beach" prompts and hello to epic 250-300 word sagas!

## üåü What Does This Dragon Do? üåü

Transform your prompts from this:
```
A bioluminescent mushroom forest inhabited by miniature clockwork dragons
```

Into THIS legendary tome:
```
A breathtaking ultra-wide panoramic vista of a bioluminescent fungal forest sprawling across a fractured amethyst mesa, colossal crystalline structures resembling gothic spires piercing a swirling nebula sky filled with cosmic dust and ethereal light, six-legged insectoid creatures with intricately detailed chitinous exoskeletons delicately tending glowing gardens of pulsating fungi and crystalline flora, dramatic volumetric lighting casting long, dancing shadows and illuminating iridescent spores, hyperdetailed textures of fungal gills, crystalline facets, and insectoid anatomy, art by Roger Dean and Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski with subtle influences of H.R. Giger's biomechanical aesthetic...
```

## üé≠ Magical Processing Modes üé≠

### üîÆ Enhancement Mode
Feed it your existing prompt lists and watch them grow into detailed epics with professional artistic terminology, camera specifications, and lighting descriptions.

### ‚ö° Generation Mode  
Give it a theme ("Lovecraftian horror with tentacles and dread") and it'll spawn fresh prompt variations from the void.

### üâê Chinese Token Efficiency
**The secret weapon:** Simplified Chinese prompts pack 30-40% more information into the same token budget! Generate ultra-dense prompts that squeeze maximum detail into token-limited models.

**English:** 300 words maximum
**Chinese:** Equivalent of 400+ words of information density

Perfect for multilingual models that understand Chinese but you don't need to speak it - just exploit the linguistic efficiency!

## üöÄ **New PySide6 GUI (Under Development)** üöÄ

This application is currently undergoing a significant architectural refactor. The original `tkinter`-based GUI is being replaced with a modern, robust, and maintainable interface built with **PySide6 (version 6.9.1)**. This section outlines the new architecture.

### Architectural Principles

The new design is guided by the principle of **Separation of Concerns**, moving away from a single-file script to a modular structure that is easier to manage and extend. It loosely follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

-   **`main.py` (View/Controller)**: The main application entry point, responsible for creating and managing all GUI elements using PySide6 widgets. It handles user interactions and orchestrates calls to the business logic.
-   **`llm_integration.py` (Model)**: Contains the core business logic. All interactions with the Ollama API‚Äîsuch as fetching models, constructing prompts, and processing requests‚Äîare encapsulated here.
-   **`utils.py` (Utilities)**: A collection of shared helper functions, such as the text-cleaning logic for the LLM output.
-   **`theme.py` (Styling)**: Holds the custom QSS (Qt Style Sheets) for the "Dragon Diffusion" theme.

### Key PySide6 Features

The new implementation leverages powerful features of the Qt6 framework to create a responsive and feature-rich user experience:

-   **Widget Hierarchy & Layouts**: The UI is built with a clear hierarchy of standard widgets (`QMainWindow`, `QGroupBox`, `QTextEdit`, `QComboBox`, etc.) and organized using flexible layout managers (`QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`) to ensure the interface is clean and scales correctly.

-   **Signals and Slots**: We are using Qt's core communication mechanism to decouple components. For example, a button's `clicked` signal is connected to a `@Slot` in the controller, which then calls the business logic. This creates a clean, event-driven architecture.

-   **Asynchronous Operations with `QThread`**: All network requests to the Ollama API will be executed in a background thread (`QThread`). This is crucial for ensuring the GUI remains responsive and does not "freeze" while waiting for the LLM to generate a response. The thread will use signals to send data and progress updates back to the main UI thread safely.

-   **Dynamic Theming Engine**: The new GUI features a flexible theming system:
    -   **`QStyleFactory`**: Users can switch between native-looking application styles like "Fusion", "Windows", and "macOS". "Fusion" is used as the default for a consistent cross-platform look.
    -   **Color Schemes**: Full support for light and dark modes by manipulating the `Qt.ColorScheme`.
    -   **Custom QSS**: The original "Welsh Dragon" theme is implemented as a custom stylesheet (`.qss`) that can be applied on top of any style, demonstrating the full power of Qt's styling capabilities.

-   **Modern Idioms**: The new codebase adheres to modern PySide6 best practices, including the use of **scoped enums** (e.g., `Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignHCenter`) for improved readability and type safety, and Pythonic decorators (`@Slot`, `@Property`) for defining Qt behavior.

## üêõ Troubleshooting Dragon Issues üêõ

**Dragon Won't Start?**
- Check Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Verify Python dependencies: `pip list`
- Ensure port 11434 is free

**Slow Processing?**
- Sparse prompts trigger more retries (normal behaviour!)
- Use more detailed input for faster processing
- Check model performance

**Truncated Chinese Output?**
- Normal for token-dense processing
- Enhanced cleaning handles most issues
- Chinese efficiency sometimes hits limits

**UI Layout Issues?**
- Text areas should resize properly
- Check window size and scaling
- Grid layout self-adjusts

## üé≠ Advanced Dragon Taming üé≠

### Custom System Prompts
Modify enhancement styles by editing system prompts in the respective language functions.

### Token Efficiency Tuning
Adjust character/word count targets in the validation logic for different density requirements.

### Cross-Language Workflows
Experiment with English‚ÜíChinese‚ÜíEnglish chains for unique prompt variations.
